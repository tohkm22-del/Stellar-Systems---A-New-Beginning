# Stellar Systems, The Start
Stellar Systems-V1.0

Xeroon - WIP - No analog

### ISSUES
I'm not sure if Stellar Systems conflicts with mods like KSS2, Promised Worlds, or Kcalbeloh. If it does conflict, please tell me here on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ut3c2edz)  
If there are any other issue report them to me, thank you!

### INSTALLATION
Download and unzip the Stellar Systems, and put the Stellar Systems into your GameData.
